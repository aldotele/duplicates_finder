I can find a way to move the duplicate and original files (e.g. I think of images mainly) into a new directory,
renaming them incrementally. For example, when I find a duplicate, I move the duplicate into e new directory and
copy the original into the new directory, and rename them as '1' and '1copy'. Then when I find the second duplicate
couple, I move the duplicate and copy the original, renaming them as '2' and '2copy'.
In this way I will keep the original files where they were before, plus I still have the opportunity to compare
duplicate and original in the new directory, and if I find out some errors, for example a duplicate which
is not equal to an original, I can move them again in the previous folders. Otherwise, if duplicate and original
are actually the same, I can get rid of them.

The thing to consider is triplicate, quadruplicate (etc.) files.
In this case I have to find a way not to copy the original file every time.
In this case I can consider the name, namely if the original file has already been copied in the new directory,
I will not copy it again, I will just move the triplicate, quadruplicate (and so on) file in that new directory
for later check.


NEW IDEA -----
To keep it simple, for now I can just rename the duplicate files where they are at the moment,
without moving in a new folder
